Udacity Frogger
===============================

This is Project 3 of the Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree.  It is a clone of the [classic Frogger game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger).

To Play:
*Use the arrows to navigate the player.
*Don't hit the bugs.
*At the top, don't fall in the water, stay on the wooden tiles.
*Each level there will be fewer tiles and the bugs will go faster.

Enjoy!
