Udacity Frogger
===============================

This is Project 3 of the Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree.  It is a clone of the [classic Frogger game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger), based on this video.

Built for this rubric: https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud015/l-3072058665/m-3072588797

To Play:
Use the arrows to navigate the player.
Don't hit the bugs.
At the top, don't fall in the water, stay on the wooden tiles.
Each level there will be fewer tiles and the bugs will go faster.

Enjoy!
